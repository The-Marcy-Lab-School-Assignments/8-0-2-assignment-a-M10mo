# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

When making requests from the frontend, you can risk exposing the API key. When you make a request from the server, it works in the back-end of the given application or site, so it is not seen by the user. The operations that occur in the back end aren't seen by the user (or client).
